Intergration of immutable passport with application

Introduction: 
Immutable Passport is a powerful tool for secure authentication and user management, and it works well with a wide range of applications

STEP 1 :CREATING A SIMPLE APPLICATION OR GIT CLONING A REPO OF A SAMPLE APPLICATION

  Before starting this step, ensure you do the following:
   (i) Install Node.js in your machine. You can download it from https://nodejs.org/en/download. Cheak if you have sucessfully installed by running (node -v) command on your terminal.
   (ii) A code editor of your choice eg. Visual studio code.
     
    Option 1:CREATING A SIMPLE APPLICATION
      # Create a new directory for your project
           mkdir my-immutable-passport-app
      # Navigate to the project directory
            cd my-immutable-passport-app
      # Initialize a new Node.js project
            npm init -y
      Now, create an entry file for your application, for example, app.js, and add the following code to set up a basic Express.js server:
      // app.js
        const express = require('express');
        const app = express();
        const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
        
        app.get('/', (req, res) => {
          res.send('Hello, Immutable Passport!');
        });
        
        app.listen(port, () => {
          console.log(`Server is running on port ${port}`);
        });

      Option 2:  GIT CLONNING A SIMPLE APPLICATION REPOSITORY
       You can also clone a simple Node.js application from a repository. Here's an example using Git:
         # Clone a simple Node.js application repository
          git clone <repository_url> my-immutable-passport-app
         # Navigate to the project directory
          cd my-immutable-passport-app

STEP 2:REGISTERING THE APP ON IMMUTABLE DEVELOPER HUB

      To use immutable pasport on your application you must register it in the immutable developer hub, follow this link     
      https://hub.immutable.com/
      (i)When there, Under "My Projects" tab click the "Add Project icon" ![image](https://github.com/Schlomo-khalidi/immutable passport/assets/95560606/98098ed5-2c8d-433c-81df-1777783e092b)
      (ii) Choose a name and enter it as your project name then select the rollup to create an new project ![image](https://github.com/Schlomo-khalidi/immutable-passport/assets/95560606/fd882413-94cd-4747-adec-bd5c4e450164)
      (iii) Enter the environment name and select testnet, then click the create button ![image](https://github.com/Schlomo-khalidi/immutable-passport/assets/95560606/44b14546-2f41-4e31-9085-2bff2f947ab8)
     (iv) Then you can navigate to the Passport config screen and create a passport client for your created environment. On the Passport tab, click "Add Client". For application type choose "Web application", for client name, enter the name of your application. Then proceed to enter the Logout URL's. When choosing Logout url's, separate multiple logout URLs with commas, use https:// , do not use localhost for production, avoid custom URI schemes, except for native clients. Then finnaly enter the Callback URLs, these URLs will be called back after user authentication. When entering the callBack URLs, Separate multiple callback URLs with commas, use https://, you can use the star symbol * as a wildcard for subdomains ![image](https://github.com/Schlomo-khalidi/immutable-passport/assets/95560606/79b2a04e-0e4e-4a79-b701-d2b5ef2769f0)
      (v) Click the create button and take note of the Client ID, Callback URLs, and the Logout URLs that you enterd as you will need these to initialise the Passport module in your application. ![image](https://github.com/Schlomo-khalidi/immutable-passport/assets/95560606/4c56121c-7bea-4bfb-9696-101ee3808066)

STEP 3: INSTALING AND INITIALIZING THE PASPORT CLIENT

  In this step, we shall be installing the pasport SDK and initializing the passport client, follow the following steps:
  (i) Before proceeding ensure nvm is installed on your matchine you can follow this guide to do so https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#install--update-script. confirm nvm is successfully installed by running the commnad nvm-v on your terminal.
  (ii) To install the immutable SDK, run the following command in your project root directory - npm install -D @imtbl/sdk
    #TROUBLESHOOTING: immutable SDK is still in early development, should complications arise, use the following commands to ensure immutable SDK is correctly installed .rm -Rf node_modules, npm cache clean --force, npm i
  (iii) Install the dependancies using the following command - npm install -D typescript ts-node
  (iv) Then proceed to initialize the pasport client in your Node.js application. You will do this in your main application file (e.g., "app.js" or "index.js"). The passport constructor accepts pasportModuleConfiguration which has the following interface
       interface PassportModuleConfiguration {
          baseConfig: ImmutableConfiguration;
          clientId: string;
          logoutRedirectUri: string;
          logoutMode?: 'redirect' | 'silent'; // defaults to 'redirect'
          redirectUri: string;
          scope?: string;
          audience?: string;
        }
 in the code above: (1) The baseConfig is an instance of immutable configuration that defines shared configurations accross all immutable modules, such as the environment. It can be initialized as follows:
                                       import { config } from '@imtbl/sdk';
                                        const baseConfig = new config.ImmutableConfiguration({
                                        environment: config.Environment.PRODUCTION,
                                      });
           NOTE: the environment variable can either be Environment.sandbox(The default test network) or Environment.PRODUCTION(for ethereum mainnet network).
                   (2) Client ID: The unique identifier of the application that was registered in the Immutable Developer Hub
                   (3) logoutRedirectUri: The URI of your application that users will be redirected to after successfully logging out. This value must match one of the Logout URL's that have been set against your client in the Immutable Developer Hub
                   (4) redirectUri: The URI of your application that users will be redirected to after successfully authenticating. This value must match one of the Callback URLs that have been set against your client in the Immutable Developer Hub
                   (5) scope: A string containing the scope(s) that specify what access privileges are being requested, with each scope being separated by a space. The following custom scopes are supported: transact: Allows the authenticating application to interact with the users Passport wallet. Other scopes recomended are : openid, offline_access and email.
                   (6) audience: A string containing the audience(s) that the issued token is intended for, with each audience being separated by a space. Passport currently supports the following audiences: platform_api: The identifier for the Immutable protocol APIs

         Below is an example of how to initialize the Passport client with the required configuration:
               import { config, passport  } from '@imtbl/sdk';
               const passportInstance = new passport.Passport({
                baseConfig: new config.ImmutableConfiguration({
                  environment: config.Environment.PRODUCTION,
                }),
                clientId: '<YOUR_CLIENT_ID>',
                redirectUri: 'https://example.com',
                logoutRedirectUri: 'https://example.com/logout',
                audience: 'platform_api',
                scope: 'openid offline_access email transact'
              });


STEP 4: LOGGING IN A USER WITH PASPORT

    PROCEDURE 1: Initialize the provider:
      import {ethers} from 'ethers';
      const passportProvider = passport.connectEvm();
      const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3provider(passportProvider);
      //use the provider as you would any other Ethereum provider:
        const signer = provider.getSigner();
        const address = await signer.getAddress();

      PROCEDURE 2: Trigger the login proccess
        The login flow is triggered by calling the requestAccounts RPC on the Passport provider:
         import {ethers} from 'ethers';
         const passportProvider = passport.connectEvm();
         const provider = new ethers.providers.Web3Provider(passportProvider);
          const accounts = await provider.send("eth_requestAccounts", []);

      PROCEDURE 3: Configure the login Callback
